**Professional Development:**

Both of us intend to use this project as a sort of portfolio center piece, so professional development has been a focus from the start. We want to leverage the project as a way to build tangible development skills in areas that we haven’t been able to experience through our co-ops or coursework, like UI/UX and web dev for data visualization. Because we want to present this project as a showcase of our skills, we do not plan to claim any kind of pseudo-anonymity as can be common in online gaming communities. Our released tool will be directly and publicly associated with our names for possible collaborators or employers to see. This also means that our reputations within the collegiate Overwatch community - especially Colin - will be at least somewhat tied to the project. 

**Security Concerns:**

Security will be a concern if and when we store any game data that users might consider sensitive. Primarily this would include data from private scrims between teams who wouldn’t want their play habits to be publicly displayed. While implementing basic functionality we are considering avoiding the use of a database altogether, instead opting for users to upload their own game data only temporarily for analysis. If and when a database for long term storage of data is incorporated, some distinction between public and private data will be needed and measures will have to be taken to prevent malicious access of anything deemed private.

**Social Impact:**

A big issue with data visualization using video games as they currently stand is their inaccessibility to outsiders. If someone isn’t in the community for a specific game or games as a whole, it can be difficult for them to understand or approach the information that the visualization is trying to convey. While the main purpose of our project is to provide a tool that can help players improve through visualizations, it is also valuable to consider the takeaways that non-gamer viewers can get from our tool. 

**Diversity and Cultural Constraints:**

Video games are a global medium, and Overwatch specifically attracts users from all over the world. Additionally, many collegiate esports teams include international students on their rosters. Because of these factors, our team has to consider that our final product could be used by those who are not native english speakers. In an effort to make our data analysis tool usable and accessible for those for whom English is not their first language, we must make sure that our application uses recognizable icons and simple language. This will reduce the chances of users being unable to understand how to use our application.
